    <h2>Advance Reviews of<br><em>Beyond&nbsp;Banksters: Resisting the New&nbsp;Feudalism</em></h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"A powerful and chilling investigation into an emerging global oligarchy of banks and corporations. Acutely insightful, <em>Beyond Banksters</em> digs deep into the nature of this new order and its repressive and impoverishing effects, while also revealing possibilities for resistance and change. Written with wit and clarity, <em>Beyond Banksters</em> is not only informative but a pleasure to read."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Provocative, profound, challenging and suffused with perceptive clarity, <em>Beyond Banksters: Resisting the New Feudalism</em> will doubtless elicit joy from those who agree and rage from those who don't - precisely what we expect from this gadfly extraordinaire.&rdquo;</p>
        <cite>&mdash; <a href="http://vancouversun.com/author/stephenhumesun">Stephen Hume</a>, author and <em>Vancouver Sun</em> columnist</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Always cutting edge, writer Joyce Nelson has penned a chilling dissection of the hidden-in-plain-view takeover of Canada by a global economic elite and their Banksters. The tightening noose of foreign economic domination that serves the billionaire class is choking-off Canada's very sovereignty. Ms. Nelson brilliantly exposes this crisis in a wakeup call that reads like a spy thriller. Unfortunately, this is not fiction but reality, the sober, blunt truth that politicians and the mainstream media spin and hide. If you care about your economic future, read this book and act.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Read this book, and then help put a stop to the on-going rip-off. Your children and grandchildren will thank you.&rdquo;</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;This well researched book sheds new light on what is really going on in the financial world, and anyone who cares about Canada would be well advised to read it.&rdquo;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;In the political confusion, what's needed is a focal point - a sort of history and playbook combination, a reference point and <em>Beyond Banksters: Resisting the New Feudalism</em> has provided this brilliantly. With eminently readable, short chapters, free of jargon, this very fine book by prominent Canadian author Joyce Nelson is a must for anyone who wants to understand what's happening.&rdquo;<p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;Hard hitting, well researched, succinct, fast-paced, <em>Beyond Banksters</em> lays bare the usually hidden world of Canadian and international bankers. Want to know how to disentangle the web of banks buying up and privatizing Canada's public assets? Read <em>Beyond Banksters</em> and learn about the central players and their cozy relations with governments and international fraudsters. Written by one of Canada's best freelance investigative writers, this is a hopeful book, offering attractive alternatives to rule by banksters.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Read it and then get your Member of Parliament to read it.&rdquo;</p>
